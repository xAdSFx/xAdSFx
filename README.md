Hi there! I'm Andr√© Fernandes and I'm currently a computer science student at the University of Aveiro. I'm passionate about using technology to solve problems and create innovative solutions. In my free time, I enjoy learning about new programming languages and technologies, as well as contributing to open-source projects on GitHub.

In my current role as a computer science student, I have gained valuable experience in software development, problem-solving, and critical thinking. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I believe that working on open-source projects is a great way to do that.

If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out to me on GitHub. I'm always open to new connections and opportunities. Thanks for stopping by!
